# ---------- Prefect deployment ----------
# This yaml is the configuration file for a prefect deployment in a kubernetes cluster
# The following are the steps to create and run a deployment in a jupyter notebook or terminal:
# 1. Copy rs-demo/prefect_deployment to ~/rs-demo
# 2. Open a terminal in your jupyterlab:
# rspy@jupyter-user:~/$ cd ~/rs-demo

# 3. Create a conda environment by running the following commands:
# rspy@jupyter-user:~/rs-demo$ conda init 
# rspy@jupyter-user:~/rs-demo$ bash 
# (base) rspy@jupyter-user:~/rs-demo$ conda create -y -n prefect3 python=3.11 
# (base) rspy@jupyter-user:~/rs-demo$ conda activate prefect3      
# (prefect3) rspy@jupyter-user:~/rs-demo$ pip install -U prefect==3.1.4 
# (prefect3) rspy@jupyter-user:~/rs-demo$ PREFECT_API_URL="http://prefect3-endpoint.cluster:4200/api" 

# 4. Check if the prefect blocks secrets exist already:
# (prefect3) rspy@jupyter-user:~/rs-demo$ prefect blocks ls
# A table with api-token-block and dask-gateway-address-block in Name column should appear
# Otherwise, you have to create these two secrets. For this, use rs-demo/prefect_deployment/secrets/create_secrets.py script
# (prefect3) rspy@jupyter-user:~/rs-demo$ python create_secrets.py '[("realapitokenvaluehere", "api-token-block"), ("http://link-to-traefik-dask-gateway-here", "dask-gateway-address-block")]'

# 5. Run:  
# (prefect3) rspy@jupyter-user:~/rs-demo$ prefect deploy --prefect-file prefect_deployment/prefect_hello_world.yaml
# Follow the steps of this command

# 5. Launch the deployment:
# (prefect3) rspy@jupyter-user:~/rs-demo$ prefect deployment run 'dask_cluster/staging_deployment'

# Generic metadata about this project
name: prefect_hello_world_deployment
prefect-version: 3.1.4
